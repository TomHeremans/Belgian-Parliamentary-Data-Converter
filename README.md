# Belgian-Parliamentary-Data-Converter
This page contains notebooks that prepare parliamentary data of the Belgian Chamber of Representatives for digital analysis. Based on the corpus made available on the platform. The goal of this project is to make the text to be quicker navigatable and more flexible in historical or linguistic analysis till a more stable academic version pops up. This page contains the tools based on the JSON-files of the Parliamentary Acts as published on [Plenum](ww.plenum.be) and to be obtained through [TextGain](www.textgain.com). 

# What does this page contain
* Notebooks that make data analysis possible
* Speaker lists which link different versions of names with standardized ones and parties
* Code that groups the session files per legislature
* A small PDF file with guidelines and explanation.

**NOTE: The code splits speeches based on paragraph level.**
  
# What is *not* available on this page
* The parliamentary JSON-files themself. It's too large and most of it is under copyright. Contact the instances above for the source files.
* The excel file that connects the sessions with correct legislature. Ask the instances for the correct linkage.
